# daoscan

DAOScan is a system which analyses Ethereum's blockchain to easily access information about Aragon DAOs operating on Ethereum.

This allows the real-time collation of data to populate a human-centric view of the DAOs that a user is participating in.

DAOScan is a project as part of the [My DAO Dashboard](https://github.com/my-dao-dashboard) group - an [ETHBerlin Zwei](https://ethberlinzwei.com/) project. You can join the community on [My DAO Dashboard Telegram Channel](https://t.me/mydaodashboard)
